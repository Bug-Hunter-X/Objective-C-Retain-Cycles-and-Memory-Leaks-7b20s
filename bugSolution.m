The solution involves breaking the retain cycle by using weak references for delegates and carefully managing strong self references in blocks.  For the delegate case, ensure that your delegate property is weak and set to nil when appropriate. In the block case, use `__weak typeof(self) weakSelf = self;` to create a weak reference to self within the block. This prevents self from being strongly retained by the block, thereby avoiding the retain cycle.

```objectivec
@interface MyObject : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, weak) id <MyObjectDelegate> delegate;
@end

@implementation MyObject
- (void)performTask {
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{ 
        __weak typeof(self) weakSelf = self;  //Fix:Use weakSelf
        [weakSelf.delegate myObjectDidComplete:weakSelf];
    });
}
@end

@implementation ViewController1
- (void)myObjectDidComplete:(MyObject *)object {
    self.myObject = nil; //Fix:remove strong ref
}
@end

```

By employing weak references and properly managing object lifecycles, the retain cycles are broken, and the objects are deallocated correctly, preventing memory leaks and improving application stability.
