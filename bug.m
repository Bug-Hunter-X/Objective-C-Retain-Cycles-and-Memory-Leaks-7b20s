In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management and object lifecycles, especially when using delegates or blocks.  Consider this scenario: a view controller (VC1) creates an instance of another class (MyObject) and sets itself as the delegate.  MyObject holds a strong reference to VC1.  If MyObject completes its task and deallocates, but VC1 still holds a strong reference to MyObject (possibly through a weak delegate property that isn't properly nullified in the dealloc method), a retain cycle occurs, preventing VC1 from being deallocated. This leads to memory leaks and potential crashes later on. 

Another example is using blocks within a class. If the block captures self strongly, and self strongly references the block (e.g., stored in a property), again a retain cycle is created.

```objectivec
@interface MyObject : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, weak) id <MyObjectDelegate> delegate; //weak delegate
@end

@protocol MyObjectDelegate <NSObject>
- (void)myObjectDidComplete:(MyObject *)object;
@end

@interface ViewController1 : UIViewController <MyObjectDelegate>  // Strong ref from MyObject to VC1
@property (nonatomic, strong) MyObject *myObject;
@end

@implementation ViewController1
- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    self.myObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];
    self.myObject.delegate = self; //VC1 has strong ref to MyObject
    [self.myObject performTask];
}

- (void)myObjectDidComplete:(MyObject *)object {
    self.myObject = nil; //Fix:remove strong ref
}

- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog(@"ViewController1 deallocated");
}
@end

```
